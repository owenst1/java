/*
        This program is meant to demonstrate
        the basic principles of a Class.
        It is a little more complex than the Dog class

        It is on page 284

        Note, this class has several design flaws.
        It is just an example to get us started with classes.
        We will improve on it as we learn.
        
        Objectives:
            1.  Discuss the concept of a class
                -A class is like a definition.
                -Notice, there is no main method, usually.
            2.  instance variables
            3.  methods within a class
